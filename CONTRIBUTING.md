* Run `cargo clippy` and fix all warnings
* Add tests for new features
* Document public APIs with `///` comments

---

### Commit Messages

* Be descriptive: "Add MariaDB support" not "Update code"
* Reference issues: "Fix #123: Handle comments"

---

### Pull Requests

* Keep PRs focused (one feature/fix per PR)
* Include tests for new functionality
* Update README if adding user-facing features
* Describe what changed and why
* More tests are always welcome for merging!

---

### Reporting Issues

* Check existing issues first
* Provide minimal reproduction case
* Use markdown code blocks for code/errors
